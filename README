An abandoned attempt at a purely configuration file controlled forum  
  
This was originally meant to be my high-school project, however other opportunities drifted my attention. 
This project is not by any means in a usable state and is I'd say around 40% done.  
  
The golang backend code is pretty good so feel free to repurpose it. But for the love of god DON'T use the Elm front end code.
My abilities has greatly improved when it comes to elm during the last year and I do gag a bit when looking at that elm.  
  
If you do however want an example of how NOT to structure pure-functional code, go ahead.
